# Customer Propensity Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of a **Customer Propensity Prediction Project**, designed to predict the likelihood of customer leads converting into successful deals. By leveraging supervised machine learning techniques, this project provides actionable insights for optimizing marketing strategies and improving customer targeting.

---

## Objective

The primary objective is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the probability of lead conversion. This helps in prioritizing potential customers, enabling more effective marketing campaigns and resource allocation.

---

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: A robust pipeline to clean, preprocess, and transform raw data for machine learning models.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Trained and evaluated multiple supervised algorithms, including **Random Forest Regression** and **LightGBM**, achieving high predictive accuracy.
- **Model Hosting**: Deployed the trained model as a REST API endpoint for real-time predictions.
- **CRM Integration**: Automated the update of customer propensity scores into a CRM system.

---

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Extract raw customer data from a CRM or similar system.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
   - Perform feature scaling and selection for optimized model performance.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Experiment with multiple machine learning algorithms.
   - Finalize the best-performing model based on accuracy and F1-score.

4. **Model Hosting**:
   - Deploy the trained model on a **Windows Virtual Machine (VM)** using Flask or FAST API for real-time predictions.

5. **Integration**:
   - Fetch data for preprocessing and push it to the hosted API for predictions.
   - Update the CRM system with the predicted propensity scores.
